## Project Structure

Typical Next.js projects maintain a clean, modular file structure for scalability:

```
/my-nextjs-app
  /app or /pages        # Main routing folders (app: newer Next.js, pages: classic)
  /components           # Shared UI components
  /public               # Static assets (images, fonts, favicon)
  /styles               # CSS modules or global styles
  /api                  # API endpoints (if using pages/api)
  next.config.js        # Next.js configuration
  package.json          # Project dependencies/scripts
  README.md             # Project overview and instructions
```
> Structure may vary depending on your Next.js version.
